## KISS Dictionary

A minimalist [select word translation extension](https://github.com/fishjar/kiss-dictionary).

### Inspiration

There are many expansions of word marking translation on the Internet, I also developed a version for my own use many years ago, but the function is somewhat different from my own needs.

This time, the front and back ends are all refactored, and functions such as word collection have been added.

This project is `"mainly for personal use"`, and there is no open source plan for the time being, but the installation files are open for those who need it.

In addition, use it together with the [Bilingual Webpage Translation Extension](https://github.com/fishjar/kiss-translator) developed by me for a better experience.
