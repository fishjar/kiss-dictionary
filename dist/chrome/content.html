Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.</li><li>Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.</li><li>React 使创建交互式 UI 变得轻而易举。为你应用的每一个状态设计简洁的视图，当数据变动时 React 能高效更新并渲染合适的组件。</li><li>以声明式编写 UI，可以让你的代码更加可靠，且方便调试。</li></ul></div></body></html>
